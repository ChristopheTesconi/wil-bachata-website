      {
        "question": "Do I need a partner to join the classes?",
        "answer": "No partner is required! We rotate partners during class so you get to dance with different people. This also helps you learn faster and makes the class more social."
      },
      {
        "question": "I've never danced before — can I still join?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our Thursday beginner class is designed for complete newcomers. We focus on fundamentals, rhythm, and connection so you can build confidence step by step."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long until I can dance socially?",
        "answer": "That depends on you and how often you practice. For instance, many students feel comfortable dancing socially after one month of consistent training — especially with the extra support from the RDF Bachata Fusion App."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I wear to class?",
        "answer": "Comfortable clothes and indoor shoes (or socks with grip). Bring water to stay hydrated. No special outfit is required — just come ready to move and have fun!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I practice outside of class?",
        "answer": "You'll have access to practice sessions, plus the RDF Bachata Fusion App, where you can review class material, work on drills, and follow challenges to progress from home."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is membership better than paying per class?",
        "answer": "Memberships give you more for less. Instead of paying class by class, you get flexible access to weekly classes, app support, and party passes — making it easier to practice consistently, save money, and truly grow as a dancer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is bachata good for fitness and social life?",
        "answer": "Yes! Bachata helps with body coordination, musicality, and confidence — while also being a fun way to meet new people and connect in a friendly community."
